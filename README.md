# CMSEngine
## What is it?
This the new code-base of my website. The old version can be seen at [http://davidsonsousa.net](http://davidsonsousa.net "My website")

## Why?
Because I need a pet project to study a couple of things. And do it with my own website seems to be the right choice.

## What I intend to study and practice with this project
* C#
* ASP.NET Core
* Entity Framework
* Unit tests
* Angular
* SASS

_Note: I am not following any particular pattern nor best practice in this project. But any help is more than welcome._
